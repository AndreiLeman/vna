# vna
A simple and cheap vector network analyzer, including support software.

**Update:** A kickstarter has been launched to bring this project to production!

# Directory layout
* Root directory: software; compile and run on any Linux based system
* pcb: schematics, pcb layouts, and simulation files
* vhdl: circuitry implemented on the fpga

# Specifications
* Frequency range: guaranteed **137MHz - 2500MHz**, typical **135MHz - 3500MHz**
* Measurement signal level (controlled using on-board switches, iteration 1 board only): **-5dBm to 10dBm, with 2dB increments**
* Measurement signal level (controlled using spi interface): **-20dBm to 10dBm, with 1dB increments**
* 3 receivers: forward coupled, reverse coupled, through; can measure S11 and S21 of a two port device. To measure S22 and S12 the DUT needs to be manually reversed.

# Physical assembly
The iteration 1 VNA is composed of 3 separate boards:
* main: contains fpga, usb interface, receivers, clock generator, LO synthesizer
* tx: signal generator; contains synthesizer, amplifier, filter bank, and programmable attenuator
* coupler: resistive directional coupler, ~15dB coupling

The iteration 2 design is a single PCB.

# Interfacing
The main board connects to a PC through usb and communicates via a virtual serial port device; the PC software sets the frequency and other parameters by sending two-byte register write commands, and the device sends averaged vector values representing magnitude and phase of measured wave.
